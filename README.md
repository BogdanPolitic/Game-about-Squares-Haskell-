# Game-about-Squares-Haskell-

The original game with graphical interface can be played at this web address: http://gameaboutsquares.com/

The code in the source has complete functionality about moving the square, and representing the whole 2D map scenario at each moving step. I've chosen the simplest possible form of reproducing the map, making a matrix with flexible dimensions, in which columns are separated by "|".
